# Week 4 - Hashing Indexes

Hash indexing is ideal for queries where you only want to test equality. 

This week there are three different tasks that you can choose from, ranging from easy, medium and hard difficulty.

## Common Tasks
* Implement the missing methods marked //TODO in **core.Bucket.java** and **core.HashTable.java**

## Option 1 (Static Hashing)
* Implement common and the **statichashing.StaticHashTable.java** file

## Option 2 (Extendible Hashing)
* Implement common and the **extendiblehashing.ExtendibleHashTable.java** file

## Option 3 (Linear Hashing)
* Implement common and the **linearhashing.LinearHashTable.java** file

For these tasks, we strongly recommend looking at the lecture slides for this week and the comments in the code to help clarify algorithms you need to implement. As with last week, tests are included in the code to assist you. You may find it helpful to contribute tests of your own on Piazza for other students to use.

Otherwise we encourage you to discuss these tasks on Piazza. You are more than welcome to share your understanding about how these algorithms work to help each other.
