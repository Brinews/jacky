		      in the text file, "a.txt".  It should also print out the size
		      of the compressed file (in bytes), the size of the decompressed
		      file (in bytes) and the compression ratio

	QUESTION 1 PART 2
	=================
		 -f : given a text file (args[1]) and the name of an output frequency file
		      (args[2]) this should count the character frequencies in the text file
		      and store these in the frequency file (with one character and its
		      frequency per line).  It should then build the huffman tree based on
		      the character frequencies, and then print out the prefix code for each
		      character

	QUESTION 1 PART 3
	=================
		 -c : given a text file (args[1]) and the name of the output compressed 
		      file (args[2]) and the name of an output frequency file (args[3]), 
		      this should compress the file

	QUESTION 1 PART 4
	=================
		 -d : given a compressed file (args[1]) and its corresponding frequency file
		      (args[2]) and the name of the output decompressed text file (args[3]),
		      this should decompress the file
